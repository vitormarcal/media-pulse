This directory is intended for storing `http-client.env.json` files.

These files should be placed here for local development and testing purposes.

**Note:** This directory is ignored in `.dockerignore` to prevent these environment files from being included in Docker builds.

The file `http-client.private.env.json` is ignored in `.gitignore` and will not be versioned in the repository.
